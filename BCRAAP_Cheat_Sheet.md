## 1️⃣ 🎭 Bias – Identifying Personal, AI & Content Bias

🔹 **AI-Generated Content Awareness.** AI models may reflect biases in their training data.  
🔹 **Algorithmic Influence.** Be mindful of recommendation algorithms shaping what information you see.  
🔹 **Be aware of your prejudices.** You are often less critical of information that aligns with your beliefs.  
🔹 **Emotional Triggers.** If the content provokes strong emotions, take extra caution before accepting or sharing.  
🔹 **Slow Down.** In a fast-paced digital world, misinformation can spread quickly. Pause and verify before engaging.  
🔹 **Practical AI Checks.** Use tools like AI content detectors to evaluate potential manipulation in AI-generated texts.

## 2️⃣ ⏳ Currency – Evaluating the Timeliness of Information

🔹 **Why was it posted now?** Assess the timing and context of publication.  
🔹 **Publication Date.** When was the information published or updated?  
🔹 **Is the information up-to-date?** Determine if it's still relevant to your topic.  
🔹 **Functional Links.** Are embedded sources and references accessible and valid?  
🔹 **Historical Context.** If outdated, does it still provide valuable background information?

## 3️⃣ 🎯 Relevance – Determining Applicability

🔹 **Does the information address your needs?** Check if it answers your questions or relates to your topic.  
🔹 **Target Audience.** Is it tailored to your level of understanding (not too basic or advanced)?  
🔹 **Comparative Analysis.** Have you reviewed multiple sources before selecting this one?  
🔹 **Academic & Professional Use.** Would you confidently cite this in research or decision-making?  
🔹 **Contextual Fit.** Does the information align with your research goals or discussion topic?

## 4️⃣ 🏅 Authority – Checking Source & AI Credibility

🔹 **Who is behind the information?** Identify the author, publisher, or sponsoring organization.  
🔹 **AI-Generated Content.** Was the information produced by AI? If so, was it fact-checked by a human?  
🔹 **Credentials & Affiliations.** Does the author have qualifications relevant to the topic?  
🔹 **Contact Information.** Look for publisher details, email addresses, or other forms of verification.  
🔹 **Domain Indicators.** Does the URL suggest a credible institution (e.g., .gov, .edu, .org)?  
🔹 **Trustworthiness.** Is the source known for reliable and factual reporting?  
🔹 **Third-Party Validation.** Are other trusted sources citing or verifying this information?

## 5️⃣ ✅ Accuracy – Validating Reliability, AI & Truthfulness

🔹 **Source of Information.** Where does the content originate from?  
🔹 **AI-Generated Data.** Has AI contributed to the dataset, and is the output verified for errors?  
🔹 **Evidence-Based.** Is the information backed by credible references or data?  
🔹 **Peer-Reviewed.** Has the content undergone expert evaluation?  
🔹 **Verification.** Can you confirm the details using additional sources?  
🔹 **Neutral Tone.** Does the writing avoid overt bias and emotional language?  
🔹 **Grammar & Spelling.** Are there typographical errors that indicate poor quality control?  
🔹 **Fact-Checking Tools.** Utilize fact-checking platforms like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or Google’s Fact Check Explorer.

## 6️⃣ 🎯 Purpose – Understanding the Intent & AI’s Role

🔹 **What is the purpose?** Does it aim to inform, teach, sell, entertain, or persuade?  
🔹 **AI-Generated Intent.** Is AI influencing the presentation of information for engagement, monetization, or persuasion?  
🔹 **Transparency.** Are the intentions of the author or sponsor clearly stated?  
🔹 **Fact vs. Opinion.** Distinguish between objective reporting and subjective commentary.  
🔹 **Bias Indicators.** Identify potential biases such as political, ideological, cultural, financial, or institutional motives.  
🔹 **Monetization & Influence.** Is the source benefiting financially or politically from the information presented?
