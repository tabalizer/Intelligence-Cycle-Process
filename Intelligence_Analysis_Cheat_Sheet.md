# 🧠 Intelligence Cycle: Phase 3 – Analysis & Assessment Cheat Sheet

## 🎯 Purpose
Transform raw data into **actionable insights** by using structured thinking and validated techniques.

---

## 🔄 Where it Fits in the Intelligence Cycle

1. 📌 **Planning & Direction** — Define IRs and prioritize.
2. 📥 **Collection** — Gather data based on IRs.
3. 🧠 **Processing & Analysis** — *YOU ARE HERE* — Make sense of the raw input.
4. 📤 **Dissemination** — Deliver intelligence to stakeholders.

## 📌 Core Functions of Analysis
| Function | Description | Emoji |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| 🔍 Evaluate Evidence | Assess source reliability & content credibility | 📊 |
| 🧩 Identify Patterns | Use timelines, link charts, and geospatial data | 📅 |
| ❓ Ask 5W1H | Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How | ❗ |
| ⚖️ Compare Hypotheses | Use ACH to eliminate bias & weigh options | 🧠 |
| 🛠 Validate Assumptions | Perform Key Assumption Checks | 🔧 |
| 🔄 Reframe Thinking | Apply SATs to challenge mental models | 🔄 |

## 🧰 Key Tools & Techniques
### ✅ Structured Analytic Techniques (SAT)
- ⚖️ **ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)** – Minimize confirmation bias
- 🔍 **Key Assumptions Check (KAC)** – Identify & test hidden beliefs
- 🌀 **Cone of Plausibility** – Explore possible futures
- 🕸️ **Network Analysis** – Map relationships
- 🧠 **Mind Mapping** – Organize thoughts visually
- 🔮 **Scenario Planning** – Prepare for uncertain developments

---

## 🧠 ACH Mini-Workflow
1. List all hypotheses 📋
2. Gather all relevant evidence 🔍
3. Test each hypothesis in a matrix ✅❌
4. Eliminate those contradicted by evidence 🗑
5. Select least-contradicted hypothesis 🥇
6. Reassess with new data 🔄

---

## ⚠️ Bias Busters
| Bias Type | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Confirmation Bias | ACH, challenge favorite theories |
| Mirror Imaging | Use adversarial or red hat analysis |
| Groupthink | Introduce dissent via structured debate |
| Anchoring | Reframe with "What If?" or Outside-In |

## 📦 Outputs of Analysis
- 📜 **Narrative Findings**
- 📊 **Confidence Ratings**
- 🧭 **Assumption Transparency**
- 🔁 **Recommendations & Alternatives**

---

## 🧱 Building Blocks from Other Phases
- 🗂️ **Data Categories** (Actors, Assets, Events)
- 🧠 **5W1H Framework** – Situational breakdown
- 📅 **Timelines** – Validate sequence consistency
- 🧾 **Collection Logs** – Ensure source traceability

---

## 🧠 Analysis Tips
- Think like the **enemy** 🤺
- Question your **mental model** 🤔
- Validate before you believe ✅
- Scenario test your conclusions 🚀
