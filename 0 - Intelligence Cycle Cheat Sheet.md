# 🔄 Intelligence Cycle Cheat Sheet

The Intelligence Cycle is a structured, iterative process used to produce high-quality, actionable intelligence. Based on international standards (e.g., NATO), it consists of four main phases. Each phase is critical and builds upon the previous one.

---

## 🧩 Phase 1: Planning & Direction

### 🎯 Purpose
To define what the decision-makers need to know and how intelligence will meet those needs. This sets the foundation for the entire intelligence operation.

### 🛠️ Key Elements
- **Identify Intelligence Requirements (IRs):** What are the decision-makers' key questions?
- **Clarify Needs:** Use direct dialogue to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Define Scope & Priorities:** Focus efforts on high-value gaps.
- **Avoid Scope Creep:** Stay aligned with original IRs unless re-scoped deliberately.
- **Track & Update IRs:** Maintain relevance through evolving threat landscapes.

### 🧠 Why It Matters
If you get this step wrong, every subsequent phase is compromised. This phase ensures your intelligence efforts are targeted, lawful, and efficient.

## 📥 Phase 2: Collection

### 📚 Purpose
To gather the right information that can answer the identified IRs. The information must be accurate, timely, and legally obtained.

### 🧰 Collection Management
- **Plan Before You Collect:** Match methods to each IR.
- **Use Internal & External Sources:** Combine known data with new sources.
- **Respect Legal & Ethical Boundaries:** Follow GDPR, internal policies, and national laws.
- **Log & Document Everything:** Ensure traceability and compliance.

### 📡 Collection Methods
- **HUMINT:** Interviews, internal sources, observations
- **OSINT:** News, websites, social media, forums
- **FININT:** Financial transaction and behavior analysis
- **GEOINT:** Maps, satellite imagery, location metadata
- **SIGINT:** Network traffic, communications metadata

### ⚠️ Pitfalls to Avoid
- Data overload without filtering
- Unverified or untrustworthy sources
- Ignoring existing internal intelligence

## 🧠 Phase 3: Analysis & Assessment

### 📊 Purpose
To transform raw information into actionable, meaningful insights that support specific decisions.

### 🔍 Structured Techniques
- **🔗 Link Analysis:** Map and analyze relationships.
- **❓ 5W1H + SoWhat:** Fully explore who, what, when, where, why, how, and why it matters.
- **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Validate events by physical location.
- **📅 Timeline Analysis:** Check for inconsistencies or patterns in event sequences.
- **⚖️ ACH:** Challenge assumptions through competing hypotheses.
- **📈 Probability Matrix:** Add a confidence level to all findings.

### 📦 Output: The Intelligence Product
- **Summary of Findings:** What do we now know?
- **Gaps & Uncertainties:** What do we still not know?
- **Reliability Matrix:** Source and information credibility.
- **Recommended Actions:** If required, what steps should be taken?

### 🧠 Bias Control
- Avoid gut-feeling-only conclusions
- Use structured thinking to limit cognitive bias
- Cross-validate with multiple techniques

## 📤 Phase 4: Dissemination

### 📦 Purpose
To deliver the finished intelligence product in a format and at a time that meets the user's needs.

### 🧾 Communication Strategy
- **Know Your Audience:** Format and tone must match the end-user.
- **Tailor the Message:** Tactical units need details; execs want concise impact.
- **Clarity is Key:** Use visuals, timelines, charts where appropriate.
- **Be Timely:** Intelligence delayed is intelligence denied.

### 🔐 Distribution Control (TLP Protocol)
- **🔴 TLP:RED** – For individual use only, no redistribution.
- **🟠 TLP:AMBER** – Internal & client sharing on a need-to-know basis.
- **🟢 TLP:GREEN** – Share within trusted community only.
- **⚪ TLP:CLEAR** – Open/public sharing permitted.

### 🔄 Feedback Loop
- Collect reactions, updates, and new IRs.
- Continuously improve the intelligence cycle.

🧭 **Remember**: This cycle is iterative, not linear. Good intelligence is always evolving.
