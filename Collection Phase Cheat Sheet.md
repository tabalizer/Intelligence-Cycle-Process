### 🎯 Get the right info. At the right time. From the right source.

## 🧠 What is the Collection Phase?

The Collection Phase is the second step in the Intelligence Cycle. It involves the **targeted gathering of raw information** that addresses previously defined Intelligence Requirements (IRs). This phase translates high-level questions into tactical actions to obtain data from trusted sources in a legal, timely, and ethical manner.

**Why it matters:**  
📉 If you collect irrelevant, outdated, or unverifiable data — the entire intelligence product is compromised.  
✅ When done right, the Collection Phase ensures that decision-makers receive timely, actionable, and reliable insights.

## 🔄 Where it Fits in the Intelligence Cycle

1. 📌 **Planning & Direction** — Define IRs and prioritize.
2. 📥 **Collection** — *YOU ARE HERE* — Gather data based on IRs.
3. 🧠 **Processing & Analysis** — Make sense of the raw input.
4. 📤 **Dissemination** — Deliver intelligence to stakeholders.

## 🛠️ How to Approach Collection

A professional collection operation uses structured planning, diverse source types, validated methods, and a continuous feedback loop. This involves:

- 🎯 Translating IRs into specific data needs
- 🔍 Choosing appropriate sources (OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, etc.)
- 📋 Building a clear Collection Plan (ICP)
- 👥 Assigning responsibilities and setting deadlines
- 📡 Gathering and documenting everything systematically
- 🧪 Validating sources and managing risks

| 👥 **Task Teams** | Assign responsibilities & brief collectors. |

---

## 🗺️ Developing an Intelligence Collection Plan (ICP)

> 📌 **Definition:** The ICP is a structured, living document that organizes **what information needs to be collected**, **why**, **by whom**, **how**, and **when** — aligned directly with strategic intelligence requirements (IRs).

| 👥 **Tasking**            | Assign specific responsibilities to assets, teams, or platforms.              |
| ⏰ **Timeline**           | Set collection start/end dates and checkpoints for each requirement.          |
| 📈 **Monitoring & QA**    | Define how collection progress and quality will be tracked and assessed.      |
| 🔄 **Adaptability**       | ICP must be flexible to integrate evolving threats, IRs, and field updates.   |
