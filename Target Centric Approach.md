# 🧠 Target-Centric Intelligence Cycle Cheat Sheet

> 🔄 A dynamic, collaborative alternative to the traditional intelligence cycle, where everyone (analysts, collectors, consumers) co-creates a unified understanding of the target.

---

## 🕸️ Core Principles

- 👥 **Collaboration-Driven:** Analysts, collectors, and consumers work together continuously.
- 🔄 **Iterative Process:** Feedback loops at every stage.
- 🧩 **Model-Based Thinking:** Build and refine a target model.
- 📡 **Multisource Intelligence:** Leverage all INTs (OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, etc.).
- 🎯 **Target-Focused:** All efforts orbit around understanding the target system deeply.

---

## 🔁 Cycle Stages (Non-Linear & Overlapping)

### 1. 🧱 **Model Construction**
- Build a conceptual model of the target 🎯.
- Focus on: **Structure**, **Function**, **Process** of the target system.
- Outcome: Analytical framework that guides all subsequent steps.

### 2. 🛰️ **Collection & Sourcing**
- Gather intel from multiple sources:
  - 📚 OSINT
  - 🧍 HUMINT
  - 🛰️ IMINT
  - 📞 SIGINT
  - ⚙️ MASINT
- Sources are evaluated **collaboratively** for **relevance & credibility**.

### 3. 🧬 **Model Population**
- Insert evidence into the model.
- Identify:
  - 🕳️ Gaps in knowledge
  - ⚖️ Conflicting data
  - 🔍 Areas needing further investigation

### 4. 🔄 **Feedback & Refinement**
- All participants can challenge, question, or refine the model at any time.
- Continuous **peer-review** and **customer feedback**.

### 5. 🧠 **Analysis & Interpretation**
- Develop hypotheses and narratives from the populated model.
- Use structured analytic techniques when appropriate:
  - 🧮 ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)
  - 🧱 Red Teaming
  - 🕵️ Indicators & Warnings

### 6. 📢 **Dissemination**
- Deliver insights in actionable form to decision-makers.
- Product is **interactive**, not final—feedback shapes further work.

## 🧩 Organizational Analysis Tips

- 🔍 **Structure** – Who's who and their roles.
- 🛠️ **Function** – What decisions the organization makes.
- 🔄 **Process** – How it operates day-to-day.

## ⚠️ Strengths & Weaknesses

### ✅ Strengths
- 🚀 Rapid adaptation to changing realities
- 💬 Encourages transparency and challenge culture
- 🤝 Reduces "stovepiping" and "information hoarding"
- 🔍 Highlights gaps early

### ❌ Weaknesses
- ⏱️ Time-intensive; may delay final product
- ⚖️ Requires high trust and inter-team cooperation
- 📊 Can suffer from over-complexity without discipline

## 🔧 Pro Tip: Use F3EA for Tactical Targeting
> 💣 Used by military units (e.g. JSOC) in high-tempo environments

- **Find** 🔎 – Identify the target
- **Fix** 📍 – Track and locate precisely
- **Finish** 🔫 – Execute operational action
- **Exploit** 📂 – Extract actionable intel
- **Analyze** 🧠 – Feed results back into the model



---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- 🧠 **Think in systems**, not snapshots.
- 🤔 **Encourage dissent and alternate views**.
- 📈 **Continuously evolve the model**—never treat it as final.
- 🔄 **Keep analysts close to collectors and consumers**.
